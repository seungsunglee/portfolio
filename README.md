## About Me

I am a web developer from Japan, currently staying in Sydney. I have over five years of experience in web development, with a particular expertise in frontend development using React.

In the past, I built and operated a classified website from scratch using React and Next.js for the frontend and Python and Django for the backend. 

While I do not have business experience in web development, I constantly acquire the latest knowledge and dedicate myself to coding every day.
